Its a rolling rolling roll roll notes:

- Da  preview anim should show you how the rolls should move.

-There are two different types of rolls, a big one and a 
small one. They both have different timings, the small
one moves faster. 

-BehindGround means that this anim should play behind the
first background layer (where we walk)

-FrontofGround means that this anim should play in
front of the first background layer, but behind coins,
enemies and the player.

-InFrontofAll means that this anim should play
in front of EVERYTHING.

-Currently the rolls just dissapear when they end. This
might look fine, it might not. Either way I don't
have the time to animate a nice solution.

-The hazard collision box should prob appear between the
last half of the FrontofGround anim and a bit after
the start of the InFrontofAll anim. You can
figure it out tho.
