Notes:

-Preview images has been provided for the different menus so you can 
position everything correctly. Place it into the game with low
opacity as a guide if you need to

-As stated in the previous menu notes files, these assets need to be 
placed in the part 2 assets of the menu (basically after the MenuZOOM
anim has finished). The menu assets need to be placed in between
MenuTop and MenuBottom. MenuTop needs to be on top!
(if this is too confusing just ask me, but you can figure it out its
not hard duh)

- Only Ability and Inv menus have been provided. The Status and Options menu
will have to wait since its not a priority for the uni build

- The DP bar is a temporary static image so far since we haven't
decided how it'll work

-The Inv menu has no sprites for items/equips since we haven't decided
what we'll have in the uni build

Notes for me (incase I forget in the future): 

- The selection expansion for the inv and ability icon blocks is 25 pix with
curve expansion. Just select the inside of the lineart for the menu icons.
(just the block, not the image/number overlaying it)
