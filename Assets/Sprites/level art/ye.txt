ye some quick notes.

-The area above the first bonus portal (theres a muscloaf there and the art has vines wrapping around
a long platform). The hazards there used to be too big which made it hard to go through. When I drew
the art I made it so that the hazard blocks can be smaller so. Yh make them smaller. Fit it to da art.

-something weird about those baguettes. They are too big, dont move as far as they used to, and are a tad
bit too fast. Almost impossible to time.

-Rolls... Really don't work lmao, thank you for puttin them in tho ;D

--- Remember to set the level art to Compression: None, Size: 8192. Before I told you to set filter to "point(no)".
Well actually turns that that's why our art was jaggy. Leave it as "bilinnear". Make sure all big art including
the sky backgrounds are set like this.

-Level music doesnt seem to loop. Hmmmm!

-dat menu OH MA GAWD.

-Game plays well, everything is well expect for some slightly small level design issues and bugs we
already know about. Yip yop.

-No backgrounds because I'm a gangsta

This will be all the art you see from me till the 21st (my deadline). I can do small lil things if you need me to
in the meantime, but really I need to finish ma comic. Good work man, can't believe we have a decent 2002 newgrounds
flashgame in 3 months!
