# Dream Strike - Final Year Project

## Description

#### As a part of my final year project, I have created a platformer game called Dream Strike where the player is able to customise their abilities that allows for unique playstyles. The game itself boasts cool mechanics, careful ability management, exceptional level design, challenging bonus stages, hilarious sound effects and a quirky tone without straying too far from its genre.

#### * - Will only work if the ability is equipped or obtained

## Notes
* When opening the executable you will be presented with a setup window before opening the game; the optimal way to play the game is to set the screen resolution to 1280x720 and the graphics quality to "Fantastic", anything else may cause positioning problems for the UI or make the game too fast
* To check what abilities you have, open the menu and look at the icon, a darkened icon means that the ability is not equipped where as bold icons are equipped
* On the upper right corner of the menu there are two numbers seperated by a /, the left number indicates how many dream points (DP) you are currently using, the right number shows how many you can use; this is important because equipping abilities will cost DP
* If the player gets stuck and they cannot move left or right while their respective abilites are equipped, either Cyber Slam into any nearby wall or use Mayonaise to move freely again. If you don't have either of those abilities you may need to restart the game
* If you are within a bonus stage and you are teleported outside of it before obtaining the item, you will need to restart the game as the camera will be stuck
